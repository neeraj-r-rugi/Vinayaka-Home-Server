   ```

3. **Create the required directory structure**
   ```
   project-folder/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ util.py
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.html
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index_style.css
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dash_style.css
   ```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
The simplest way to start the server with default settings:

```bash
python server.py
```

This will:
- Use `./` as the default directory (Change this to your actual drive.)
- Set password to "Dingus" (change this for security!)
- Start the server on `https://0.0.0.0:5000` with HTTPS encryption

### Secure Password Generation
For maximum security, generate a cryptographically secure password:

```bash
python server.py --generate
```

This will:
- Generate a secure 32-character password using uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters
- Display the password in the terminal (save it somewhere safe!)
- Use PBKDF2-SHA256 hashing for password storage
- Override any password specified with `--password`

**Example output:**
```
Your Secure Passkey is: K7#mN9@pQ2$vX8&wE4*rT6%yU1!sA3^z
```

### Command-Line Options

The server supports several command-line arguments for easy configuration:

```bash
python server.py [OPTIONS]
```

#### Available Options:

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--data-dir` | `-dir` | Directory to serve files from | `./` |
| `--password` | `-ps` | Password for server access | `Dingus` |
| `--exclude-dir` | `-ed` | Directories (and subdirectories) to exclude (space-separated) | None |
| `--generate` | `-gen` | Generate a secure 32-character password (overrides --password) | Disabled |
| `--debug` | `-db` | Enable Flask debug mode | Disabled |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message | - |

#### Usage Examples:

**Generate a secure password:**
```bash
python server.py --generate --data-dir "/home/username/Documents"
```

**Basic configuration with custom directory and password:**
```bash
python server.py --data-dir "/home/username/Documents" --password "MySecurePassword123"
```

**Exclude specific directories or subdirectories:**
```bash
python server.py --data-dir "/home/user/files" --exclude-dir "Private" "Confidential" "Personal" "Media/Videos"
```
> **Note:** Exclusion is robust. You can specify subdirectories (e.g., `"Media/Videos"`), and both `"Folder"` and `"Folder/"` are treated the same.

**Enable debug mode for development:**
```bash
python server.py --debug --password "DevPassword"
```

**Full configuration example with generated password:**
```bash
python server.py \
    --data-dir "/Users/john/SharedFiles" \
    --generate \
    --exclude-dir "Private" "Work" "Confidential" "Projects/Old" \
    --debug
```

**Windows example:**
```cmd
python server.py --data-dir "C:\Users\YourName\Documents" --generate
```

## HTTPS and Browser Security Warnings

### HTTPS Encryption
The server now uses **HTTPS encryption** by default with self-signed certificates (adhoc mode) for enhanced security. This means:
- All communication between your browser and the server is encrypted
- Your password and file transfers are protected from network eavesdropping
- The connection is more secure than plain HTTP

### Expected Browser Warnings
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: When you first access the server, your browser will show a security warning because the server uses a self-signed certificate. This is **normal and expected**.

**You will see warnings like:**
- "Your connection is not private"
- "Potential Security Risk Ahead"
- "This site's security certificate is not trusted"

**How to proceed safely:**
1. **Click "Advanced" or "Advanced Settings"**
2. **Click "Proceed to [your-ip]:5000 (unsafe)" or "Accept the Risk and Continue"**
3. **Some browsers may ask you to type "thisisunsafe"**

This warning appears because:
- The certificate is self-signed (not from a trusted Certificate Authority)
- This is normal for local development servers
- The encryption is still active and protecting your data
- You're connecting to your own server on your trusted network

**Browser-specific instructions:**
- **Chrome**: Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to [IP] (unsafe)"
- **Firefox**: Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Accept the Risk and Continue"
- **Safari**: Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Visit this website"
- **Edge**: Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Continue to [IP] (unsafe)"

## Configuration

### Method 1: Command-Line Arguments (Recommended)
Use the command-line options as shown above for quick and easy configuration.

### Method 2: Code Modification (Legacy)
You can also modify the default values directly in `util.py`:

```python
def init_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser:
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(prog="VinayakaHomeServer", description="A Local WAN Home Data Server")
    parser.add_argument("--data-dir", "-dir",
                        default="/your/custom/directory",  # Change this
                        help="The Directory which the server is to host.")
    parser.add_argument("--password", "-ps",
                        default="YourSecurePassword",      # Change this
                        help="The Password for Logging into your server.")
    # ... rest of the configuration
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

1. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/vinayaka-home-server
   ```

   ```bash
   python server.py --generate --exclude-dir "Private" "Personal" "Confidential" "Media/Videos"
   ```

4. **Local Network Only**: This server is designed for local network use only
5. **Firewall Configuration**: Ensure your firewall is properly configured
6. **Regular Updates**: Keep Python and Flask updated to the latest versions
7. **Save Your Password**: When using `--generate`, save the displayed password securely

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment-Specific Examples

**Student Setup with Generated Password:**
```bash
python server.py \
    --data-dir "/home/student/Documents" \
    --generate \
    --exclude-dir "Private" "Personal"
```

**Developer Setup:**
```bash
python server.py \
    --data-dir "/home/dev/Projects" \

```bash
#!/bin/bash
python server.py \
    --data-dir "/home/user/SharedFiles" \
    --generate \
    --exclude-dir "Private" "Work"
```

**Windows (server-config.bat):**
```batch
@echo off
python server.py ^
    --data-dir "C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents" ^
    --generate ^
    --exclude-dir "Private" "Work"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser security warnings (Expected behavior)**
   - **This is normal** - click "Advanced" then "Proceed" or "Accept Risk"
   - The warning appears because of the self-signed certificate
   - Your connection is still encrypted and secure

2. **Cannot connect from other devices**
   - Verify both devices are on the same network
   - Check firewall settings on the host computer
   - Ensure the server is running and listening on `0.0.0.0`
   - Use `https://` not `http://` in the URL

3. **Lost generated password**
   - The password is only displayed once when generated
   - Restart the server with `--generate` to create a new password
   - Consider saving generated passwords in a secure password manager

4. **SSL/Certificate errors**
   - These are expected with self-signed certificates
   - Follow the browser-specific instructions above to proceed
   - Ensure you're using `https://` not `http://`

5. **Permission denied errors**
   - Ensure the user running the server has read permissions for the specified `--data-dir`
   - Check directory permissions: `ls -la /path/to/directory`

6. **Files not displaying**
   - Verify the `--data-dir` path is correct and exists
   - Check if directories are listed in `--exclude-dir`

7. **Login issues**
   - Verify the password matches exactly (case-sensitive)
   - If using generated passwords, ensure you copied it correctly
   - Clear browser cookies and try again

8. **Command-line argument errors**
   - Use `python server.py --help` to see all available options
   - Ensure paths with spaces are properly quoted
   - On Windows, use forward slashes or escaped backslashes in paths

### Getting Help
```bash
# Display all available options and their descriptions
python server.py --help

# Generate a secure password and see all options
python server.py --generate --help
```

### Network Troubleshooting
```bash
# Test if server is accessible locally (note: https)
curl -k https://localhost:5000

# Find your IP address
